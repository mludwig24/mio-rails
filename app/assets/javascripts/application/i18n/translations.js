In the past, the liability damages imposed on an at-fault driver who caused a negligent fatality in Mexico were capped at 730 days multiplied by the local Mexico Minimum Wage (approximately $ 50,000 total damages in most Mexican States). Effective immediately, that limit has been increased by the Mexican Government to 5,000 days multiplied by the local Mexico minimum wage (up to approximately $ 300,000 US Dollars total damages, depending on the Mexican State). We strongly suggest that you now use the same level of care regarding Mexico Liability limits that you would use when purchasing a US or Canadian auto liability policy.

En el pasado, los daños  de responsabilidad impuestos a un conductor culpable  que causo una víctima mortal por negligencia en se limitaban a 730 días multiplicados por el salario mínimo local en México (aproximadamente $50,000 en daños totales en la mayoría de Estados en México). Con efecto inmediato, ese límite ha sido aumentado por el gobierno Mexicano a 5,000 días multiplicados por el salario mínimo local en México ( Hasta aproximadamente $300,000 Dólares en daños totales, dependiendo del Estado en México). Le sugerimos que ahora utilice el mismo nivel de atención a los límites de Responsabilidad civil en México, al nivel que utilizaría al comprar una póliza de responsabilidad en Estados Unidos o Canadá.
