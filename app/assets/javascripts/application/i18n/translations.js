In the past, the liability damages imposed on an at-fault driver who caused a negligent fatality in Mexico were capped at 730 days multiplied by the local Mexico Minimum Wage (approximately $ 50,000 total damages in most Mexican States). Effective immediately, that limit has been increased by the Mexican Government to 5,000 days multiplied by the local Mexico minimum wage (up to approximately $ 300,000 US Dollars total damages, depending on the Mexican State). We strongly suggest that you now use the same level of care regarding Mexico Liability limits that you would use when purchasing a US or Canadian auto liability policy. The radical change to Mexico Liability law means that claims for Death Liability in Mexico will now be similar to the damages that are often imposed by courts in the US and Canada in similar cases."},"pdf_reader":{"header":"PDF Documents","body":"In order to view the documents associated with this certificate you will need to have Adobe Reader installed.
