        value: Have you verified the current market value with KBB? We suggest using
          either the <a href="http://kbb.com/" target="_blank"> Kelly Blue Book</a>'s
          or <a href="http://www.nadaguides.com?" target="_blank"> NADA Guide</a>
          to determine the value of your vehicle.
        towing: You must list any and all towed units! Failing to do so can result
          in no coverage. Also, each self propelled vehicle must have its own policy
          when it is driven.

          value: Insurance policies that cover theft of or damage to a vehicle use
            the Actual Cash Value, or the present market value, as the basis for valuing
            the vehicle in the event of a loss. If you have an accident or your vehicle
            is stolen, the company will pay you based on your vehicle's Actual Cash
            Value. We suggest you use one of two auto industry guides to help you determine the present value of your vehicle. The <a href="http://www.kbb.com" target="_blank">

          model_id: Please select your vehicle model.
          make_id: Please select your vehicle make.
          enter_date: Enter the date you will be entering Mexico. If you purchase
            your policy before the day it becomes effective, it will go into effect
            at 12:01 AM on the effective date and will cover you for the entirety
            of the day (s) you enter. If you purchase your policy the same day you are entering
            Mexico, your coverage becomes effective at the time you purchase your
            policy which is date/time stamped and printed on your policy declarations page.
          leave_date: Enter the date you will be leaving Mexico. The policy will cover
            you for the entirety of the day you are leaving. All policies end at 12:01 AM
            (just after midnight). The maximum policy period is 1 year.
          Year: Enter the year of your vehicle. Vehicles over 20 years old are eligible
            for liability, legal aid, and travel assistance coverage only.
          liability_limit: Liability coverage pays for the bodily injury or property
            damage to third parties in the event that you are found negligent in a
            covered accident. Liability coverage does not provide coverage for injuries to occupants
            of your vehicle, or damages to your vehicle. We recommend purchasing a combined single limit of $300,000 CSL or more, due to recent changes in
            Mexican liability law.
          fixed_deductibles: "There are two types of deductibles available: Fixed deductibles;
                      which are $500 for collision and other Section 1 perils, and $1,000 for theft and other Section 2 perils. Percentage deductibles; which are based on the value of the vehicle,  but also
                      subject to minimums based on the vehicle type. While the minimum deductible
                      varies by company, the percentage amount for collision and other Section 1 is 2% of the vehicle's value, and the amount for theft and other section 2 perils is 5% of the vehicle's value."
          uscoll_sc: If you do not have collision and theft coverage on your current
            US/Canadian policy , please select "no" for this question. Only vehicles
            which carry collision and theft on a current (non-Mexico) policy, are eligible
            for collision and theft coverage in Mexico.
          Towing: If you are towing a trailer or another vehicle you must declare
            it on your online application. If you do not declare all towed units,
            and have an accident, you claim can be denied. To add physical damage
            coverage to a towed unit, please list a dollar value for each towed unit.
            There is no coverage for vehicles, ATVs, motorcycles, or boats once they
            are unloaded from the trailer, each of these types of vehicles will need
            a separate policy when being operated.
        app:
          license_state: You must have a valid non-Mexican Driver's license
            and be at least 18 years of age to be covered under this policy.
          first_name: Please enter the name on the vehicle registration. This can
            be a personal name or a company name. Please note that any one may legal
            drive the insured vehicle as long as they have the owners permission,
            have a valid drivers' license, and are not a Mexican citizen. It is not
            necessary to list all driver's.

      2013_law_reform:
        header: 2013 Mexico Law Reform - Higher Liability Limits Recommended
        body: Due to a radical change to Mexico Liability Law, we now recommend that all our customers purchase a minimum of $300,000 in Liability coverage, and seriously consider the $500,000 limit! In the past, the liability damages imposed on an at-fault driver who caused a negligent fatality in Mexico were capped at 730 days multiplied by the local Mexico Minimum Wage (approximately $ 50,000 total damages in most Mexican States). Effective immediately, that limit has been increased by the Mexican Government to 5,000 days multiplied by the local Mexico minimum wage (up to approximately $ 300,000 US Dollars total damages, depending on the Mexican State). We strongly suggest that you now use the same level of care regarding Mexico Liability limits that you would use when purchasing a US or Canadian auto liability policy. The radical change to Mexico Liability law means that claims for Death Liability in Mexico will now be similar to the damages that are often imposed by courts in the US and Canada in similar cases.
